# Rick & Morty App

Welcome to the Rick & Morty App repository! This iOS application is built using Swift (UIKit), SnapKit for Auto Layout, and Rick&Morty API to fetch data. The app follows the MVVM architecture pattern, utilizing protocols for flexibility and better code organization.

## Features

- View a list of characters from the Rick & Morty universe.
- Browse through character details, including their status, species, and origin.
- View a list of episodes where character was mentioned.

## Stack

- Swift (UIKit)
- SnapKit (Auto Layout)
- MVVM Architecture
- Protocols for Abstraction

## What I Learned

Through the process of building this app, I learned the importance of structuring code for maintainability and scalability. The key takeaways include:

- **MVVM Architecture:** Separating the app's components into Models, Views, and View Models improved code organization and testability. The ViewModel layer encapsulates business logic, making it easier to manage and test.

- **SnapKit for Auto Layout:** Integrating SnapKit simplified the Auto Layout process, resulting in more efficient and readable constraints.

- **Native API Integration:** Using Swift's native tools to fetch and display data from the Rick & Morty API ensured a smooth and accurate experience for users.

- **Protocols for Abstraction:** Leveraging protocols enhanced the modularity of the codebase, enabling easier maintenance and potential future expansion.
